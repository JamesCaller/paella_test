Have a usage question?
======================
The issue tracker isn't the best place for usage questions. This format is not well-suited for Q&A, and questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

- Check the paella documentation: https://github.com/polimediaupv/paella/blob/master/doc/README.md
- Ask the question in the Paella Player mailing list: https://listas.upv.es/mailman/listinfo/paellaplayer

Think you found a bug?
======================
The best bug report is a failing test in the repository as a pull request. Otherwise, please use the "BUG REPORT" template below.
